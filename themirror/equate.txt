brief in:english one is :: want supplied at a cost of n. fear+observation duration of repayment of w n :: promotes n with a debt with f^n :: as f is not satisfied :: L is a consumable factor to {group} f & o :: one solution may be :: take aside f with L with c (oh, new variable: comfort) :: recharge yourself::let's call that V :: then de-evaluate o f & n with WnF ::::: cℨw :::::

sample :: The quadratic formula is $-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} \over 2a$

w->n=f+o/time(duration) of w n <-f . promotes n with a debt with f^n
w n <- f depleats with above f^n

{solution 0}
L->f with c ->V <- devalue o f & n with wnF :: {incomplete}

with available (p)ower in regards to satisfaction of w || n and willing separation of observation
additional: w->L delivers L<-wn o-time:serie'd :: voluntary separation of o; with n stable.

o<-f^n::^n->o <-W of n<-f->o of original o.  supplying n<-fW->wno with instance of L coupled towards n w met in regard to above n with debt with f^n
